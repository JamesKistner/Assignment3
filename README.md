I found this assignment to be a nice culmination of topics we've covered thus far in class. It took some time to finish, and afterwards I realized I could've used a much more object oriented approach. I didn't realize until I finished coding it that a lot of the functionality for each menu option was the same. If I had more time I would've rewritten the program to be more object-oriented. However, it works perfectly!
